SPECLOG

This repository contains a Python script for logging data from instruments
in the SpecLab. Currently it can log data from the mass balance, the
infrared pyrometer, or both of them at the same time. By default this
program logs data from both of the instruments using their default ports,
and it will log indefinitely. The program also logs data to the screen,
which can be disabled, and also logs to a file. Currently file logging
cannot be disabled. See the options below for information on how to change
the default behavior.

Example usage:
  $ speclog -d mb /dev/tty.usbserial-FT9JW0SS -i 10 -t 3600 -o outputfile.log

Options:
  -h, --help          show the help message and exit
  -v, --version       show program's version number and exit
  -d name [port ...]  device [and port] to log (options: mb, ir)
  -e emissivity       change emissivity (default: 1.0)
  -i seconds          interval between log entries (default: 5)
  -n samples          number of samples to log (default: inf)
  -t seconds          total time to log (default: inf)
  -o filename         output file name (default: based on start time)
  -q                  suppress screen output

Output format:
  Log entries have the following format with times in UTC:
  year,month,day,hour,minute,second,mass,ir temp,ir ambient

To clone this repository:
  hg clone https://bitbucket.org/tjcrone/speclog

To update to a certain tag (version):
  hg pull && hg update v0.2

Requirements:
  pySerial

To do:
  continue working on header, include column names?
  move sample format to function
  remove the emissivity get after testing
  add option to suppress output to file?
  add additional hostname for SpecLab laptop
  look at possible sleep across midnight issue
