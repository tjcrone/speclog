SPECLOG

This repository contains a Python script for logging data from instruments
in the SpecLab. Currently it can log data from the mass balance, the
infrared pyrometer, or both of them at the same time. By default this
program logs data from both of the instruments using their default ports,
and it will log indefinitely. See the options below for information on how
to change the default behavior.

Example usage:
  $ speclog -d mb /dev/tty.usbserial-FT9JW0SS -i 10 -t 3600 -o outputfile.log

Options:
  -h, --help          show the help message and exit
  -v, --version       show program's version number and exit
  -d name [port ...]  device [and port] to log (options: mb, ir)
  -e emissivity       change emissivity (default: 1.0)
  -i seconds          interval between log entries (default: 5)
  -n samples          number of samples to log (default: inf)
  -t seconds          total time to log (default: inf)
  -o filename         output file name (default: based on start time)
  -q                  suppress output to stdout
  -qq                 suppress all screen output

Output format:
  Log entries have the following format with times in UTC:
  year,month,day,hour,minute,second,mass balance value,ir temp,ir ambient
